# phnx-frontend

this is a project where i've experimented with the [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library to see if it's a viable base for an open-sourced cross-exchange cryptocurrency portfolio manager. it works in conjunction with the exchange api backend: https://github.com/phnx-trading/exchange

```
$ git clone ...
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
